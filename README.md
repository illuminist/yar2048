# Yet Another React 2048

Created by Witsarut Sawetkanit. Based on [1024 by Veewo Studio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224) and conceptually similar to [Threes by Asher Vollmer](http://asherv.com/threes/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to play

Use keyboard's arrow keys, mouse click and drag, or touch drag to
slide tile pieces in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right. Each
tile piece has score on it, sliding them into another tile piece
with same score will combine both tile piece together.

Try to reach a piece with 2048 score and so on!
